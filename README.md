# matches_to_calendar

Takes sports teams, a Google Calendar id, and adds all future matches of those teams to that calendar, updating periodically.

Not polished! Might crash or raise errors if you don't follow the exact instructions.

## To do list:
- Install dependencies automatically
- Make the credential creation process easier
- Restrict input possibilities
- Create user interface?
- Create webapp to host it?
